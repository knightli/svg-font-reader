SVG font reader

sometime we met some problems while use icon font:

`svgfr` maybe provide some help...

## install
```
npm install svgfr -g
```

## usage

- put you svgfile in a folder
- cd to the folder in command line
- run command:
```
svgfr <svgfile>
```
- it will genarate a html file and a ttf file, then open default browser to preview this html page.
